# Awesome-Bioimage-Analysis
A collection of resources on bioimage analysis and related tools and techniques.

## Sources of bioimage datasets

- [Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection](https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/image_sets): Annotated biological image sets for testing and validation
- [NUCEXM DATASET](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/nucexm-dataset-nuclei-segmentation-expansion-microscopy): 3D Instance Segmentation of zebrafish brain nuclei in expansion microscopy
- [FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY IMAGE DATASETS FOR DEEP LEARNING SEGMENTATION OF INTRACELLULAR ORGENELLE NETWORKS](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/fluorescence-microscopy-image-datasets-deep-learning-segmentation-intracellular-orgenelle): Fluorescence microscopy images of the Endoplasmic Reticulum network and mitochondrial network in cultured live cells. The datasets have been used to evaluate and compare performance of the methods proposed in the article “Heuristic Optimization of Deep Learning Models for Segmentation of Intracellular Organelle Networks”.
- [An annotated fluorescence image dataset for training nuclear segmentation methods](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/studies/S-BSST265): This dataset contains annotated fluorescent nuclear images of different tissue origins and sample preparation types and can be used to train machine-learning based nuclear image segmentation algorithms.
