## Sources of bioimage datasets

- [Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection](https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/image_sets): Annotated biological image sets for testing and validation
- [NUCEXM DATASET](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/nucexm-dataset-nuclei-segmentation-expansion-microscopy): 3D Instance Segmentation of zebrafish brain nuclei in expansion microscopy
- [FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY IMAGE DATASETS FOR DEEP LEARNING SEGMENTATION OF INTRACELLULAR ORGENELLE NETWORKS](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/fluorescence-microscopy-image-datasets-deep-learning-segmentation-intracellular-orgenelle): Fluorescence microscopy images of the Endoplasmic Reticulum network and mitochondrial network in cultured live cells. The datasets have been used to evaluate and compare performance of the methods proposed in the article “Heuristic Optimization of Deep Learning Models for Segmentation of Intracellular Organelle Networks”.
- [An annotated fluorescence image dataset for training nuclear segmentation methods](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/studies/S-BSST265): This dataset contains annotated fluorescent nuclear images of different tissue origins and sample preparation types and can be used to train machine-learning based nuclear image segmentation algorithms.
- [UCSB Bio-Segmentation Benchmark dataset](https://bioimage.ucsb.edu/research/bio-segmentation): Consists of 2D/3D images and time-lapse sequences that can be used for evaluating the performance of novel state of the art computer vision algorithms. Tasks include segmentation, classification, and tracking.
- [PARASITIC EGG DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION IN MICROSCOPIC IMAGES](https://ieee-dataport.org/competitions/parasitic-egg-detection-and-classification-microscopic-images): The dataset contains 11 parasitic egg types. Each category has 1,000 images, suitable for classification/object recognition.
- [HUMAN SOMATIC LABEL-FREE BRIGHT-FIELD CELL IMAGES](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/human-somatic-label-free-bright-field-cell-images): Suitable for multi-class cell classification.
